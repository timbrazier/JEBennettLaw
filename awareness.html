				<p>
				We are a small specialist practice based in the centre of Sevenoaks.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				Being based outside London, we are able to offer our clients competitive regional rates by keeping our overheads to a minimum.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				We are happy to travel and indeed, our incapacitated clients often require us to meet them at
				home. Sevenoaks is extremely well placed to meet this expectation. The centre of Sevenoaks is
				approximately 2 miles away from the M25, and the town benefits from a mainline station with easy
				access to London in a little over 30 minutes.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				JE Bennett Law is committed to providing a collaborative approach to problem-solving, and offers
				a bespoke service that is tailored to the specific needs of the client. Central to this approach is the
				strength of our “team” ethic.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				In practice, this means that we are willing to work closely with other professionals involved in our
				clients’ care; rehabilitation and/or financial welfare, whilst providing our clients with the assurance
				that the work we do remains affordable and proportionate.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				For example, where personal injury or clinical negligence claims are being brought on behalf of our
				clients by specialist litigators, we are required to work closely with them to manage interim funding
				arrangements pending trial/settlement.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				We believe effective management of professional working relationships is paramount, both to
				manage clients’ needs and expectations, and to ensure excellence in overall service provision.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				In short, we pride ourselves on attention to detail, and having the sensitivity to deal with all manner
				of discrete issues.
