				Our work focuses on the protection of the vulnerable client. Most of our clients have an acquired
				brain injury and/or physical injuries sustained through an accident; disease; birth injuries, or
				infirmity.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				We are primarily concerned with ensuring our clients can access the advice they need at any given
				time. Where we are not in a position to provide the advice ourselves such as in the case of a
				divorce/family law matter, or an employment issue, we ensure that they are referred to someone
				who can advise them appropriately. For that purpose, we have strong links with key advisers at
				other law firms.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				Our work will often involve making applications to the Court of Protection for the appointment of a
				Deputy. We also advise lay deputies in relation to Court of Protection matters. We regularly assist
				in the purchase of land/property; the development of it, and the supervision of disability-related
				refurbishments.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				We can assist in as many discrete details of our clients’ lives as necessary.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				In the course of our work, it is sometimes necessary to make applications to the Court regarding care
				and welfare issues. We can provide solutions to specific problems or make applications direct to the
				Court to deal with situations that are otherwise incapable of being resolved.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				We also offer advice on safeguarding, and any associated deprivation of liberty issues, where
				appropriate.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				We are often instructed in relation to the provision of expert witness statements for personal injury
				and clinical negligence litigation cases. We can appear as a witness in such Court proceedings,
				and we also have experience in providing Court of Protection advice regarding Criminal Injury
				Compensation Authority claims, including appeals.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				Our powers of attorney services are offered to our general private clients, and we can advise on
				financial as well as welfare powers. Where our clients prefer, powers of attorney advice can be
				provided as part of our Wills service within a cost-effective package that is tailored to individual
				needs.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				In addition, we offer Probate services and can act as Executor where necessary.
